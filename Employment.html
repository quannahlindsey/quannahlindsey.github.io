    <h3>Business Intelligence Intern</h3>

    <p>I am currently working at CNI as their business intelligence analyst intern. This internship has taught me a lot about analytics and how to work effectivly with data scientists as well as data engineers to get knowledge out of data. I hop to learn a lot more throughout my internship so that I can use this knowledge in the real world. </p>
