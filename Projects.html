    <h2>DataBase Design and Implementation</h2>
    <p>During this project I worked with five others and our task was to create a working database for a virtual fly fishing company who needed help creating a database that helped with their inventory as well as their planned trips with their customers.</p>

    <h2>Data Warehouse</h2>
    <p>During this project I workes with four others to find two viable databases to merge together so that we would be able to make sense of the data and create visuals while also using statistical analysis in order to create a presentation that made sense to our class.</p>

    <h2>Chickasaw Nation Industries</h2>
    <p>During my time at CNI, I was able to work with the business solutions they had a data migration project and I was able to use my skills with ERD knowledge as well as using Lucidcharts to come up with a schema to help visualize how the data is stored</p>
