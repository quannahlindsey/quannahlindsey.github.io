        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently a senior graduate student pursuing my MS in management of information technology with a bachelors of management information systems. Throughout the past years I have learned many different aspects of the tech world and find it super exciting to learn more. I enjoy being able to take data and make sense of it so that companies are able to help their customers and those that are stakeholders within the company.

            I believe people would describe me as someone that demonstrates integrity while navigating through the business world. I am able to work individually or in teams which I feel is important in business because collaboration is important. I encourage the ideas of others, because it is important to see things through others eyes when dealing with new ideas.

            I am hoping to graduate in Spring 2022 and find a job that utilizes my strengths and knowledge so that I can navigate through the tech world and find a job that is both challenging and rewarding. Data science and analytics is challenging and changing all the time so I believe something in this field would be rewarding.
